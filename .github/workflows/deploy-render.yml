name: Disabled: Trigger Render Deploy

# This workflow previously triggered Render deployments after CI succeeded.
# The project now uses Render's auto-deploy on pushes to `main`. Keep this
# file as a disabled placeholder in case you want to re-enable API-triggered
# deploys later. The job below is intentionally guarded with `if: false` so
# it will never run.
